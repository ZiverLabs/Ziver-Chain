# Zexus 1.6.7 - Additional Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Nested Map Literal Assignment in Contract State ✅
**Problem:** Nested map literals couldn't be assigned to contract state variables via property access, failing silently and leaving the state unchanged.

**Example:**
```zexus
contract Store {
    state data = {};
    
    action set_nested(key) {
        data[key] = {"count": 0, "status": "active"};  // Previously failed
        return data[key];  // Would return null
    }
}
```

**Root Cause:** The parser's `_parse_block_statements()` method had a handler for the `DATA` keyword that was too greedy. When it encountered an identifier named `data` (tokenized as DATA keyword), it treated it as a dataclass definition (`data TypeName {...}`) instead of checking if it was being used in an expression context (e.g., `data[key] = ...`).

**Fix:** Updated the DATA handler condition in `strategy_context.py` (~line 2196):
```python
# Before:
elif token.type == DATA and not (i + 1 < len(tokens) and tokens[i + 1].type == ASSIGN):

# After:
elif token.type == DATA and i + 1 < len(tokens) and tokens[i + 1].type not in [ASSIGN, LBRACKET, DOT, LPAREN]:
```

This ensures DATA is only treated as a dataclass definition keyword when followed by a type name, not when used in:
- Direct assignment: `data = value`
- Index assignment: `data[key] = value`
- Property assignment: `data.prop = value`
- Method call: `data()`

**Impact:** 
- Nested map literals now persist correctly in contract state
- Property access assignments (`obj[key] = {...}`) work reliably
- Keywords used as variable names are handled correctly in all contexts

---

### 2. Standalone Block Statements ✅
**Problem:** Blocks `{ ... }` containing statements were being incorrectly parsed as assignment expressions, causing "Invalid assignment target" errors.

**Example:**
```zexus
{
    let temp = 10;
    print("Inside block");
}
```

**Fix:** Added dedicated handling for standalone block statements in `_parse_block_statements()` (strategy_context.py ~line 3450)
- Detects LBRACE at statement level
- Collects tokens until matching RBRACE
- Recursively parses block contents
- Properly handles nesting

**Impact:** Scoped blocks now work correctly in all contexts.

---

### 2. Keywords as Variable Names ✅
**Problem:** Reserved keywords (like `data`, `action`, `contract`, etc.) couldn't be used as variable names, causing conflicts in legitimate use cases.

**Example:**
```zexus
let data = {"value": 42};  // Previously failed
let action = "click";      // Previously failed
```

**Fix:** Implemented context-aware keyword recognition in lexer (lexer.py ~line 100)
- Added `should_allow_keyword_as_ident()` method
- Tracks last token type to determine context
- Allows keywords as identifiers after:
  - LET, CONST (variable declaration)
  - COLON (map keys, parameter types)
  - COMMA (parameter lists, map entries)
  - LPAREN/RPAREN (function arguments)
  - LBRACKET/RBRACKET (map access)
  - Comparison operators (LT, GT, EQ, etc.)
  - ASSIGN (assignment target)
  - DOT (property access)
- Always treats `true`, `false`, and `null` as keywords

**Impact:** Keywords can now be used as:
- Variable names: `let state = 5;`
- Map keys: `{"action": "click"}`  
- Parameter names: `action process(data, action) { ... }`
- Property names: `obj.data`

**Exceptions:** `true`, `false`, `null` remain strict keywords for boolean/null literals.

---

### 3. Parser Optimization - Closing Brace Handling ✅
**Problem:** Closing braces `}` and semicolons `;` after certain constructs (like map literals) were being incorrectly parsed as separate StringLiteral statements, creating spurious entries in the statement list.

**Example:**
```zexus
let config = {"key": "value"};  // The '}' and ';' were parsed as extra statements
```

**Root Cause:** The fallback expression parsing in `_parse_block_statements()` wasn't skipping separator tokens (RBRACE, SEMICOLON) at the top level, treating them as potential expressions.

**Fix:** Enhanced fallback parsing in `strategy_context.py` (lines 3488-3595):
- Skip standalone SEMICOLON and RBRACE tokens before attempting to parse
- Break on RBRACE and skip it like SEMICOLON in the fallback loop
- Filter out separator tokens (`';'`, `'}'`, `'{'`) from parsed expressions

**Impact:**
- Parser no longer creates spurious statements for separators
- Cleaner AST generation
- Better handling of complex nested structures
- All 19 edge case tests still passing

---

### 4. Contract-to-Contract References ✅
**Feature:** Contracts can now store references to other contract instances that persist across state changes.

**Implementation:** 
- Added `ContractReference` class for serializable contract references
- Implemented global `CONTRACT_REGISTRY` (address → SmartContract mapping)
- Transparent method delegation via `call_method()`
- Transparent attribute access via `get_attr()`
- Full serialization/deserialization support

**Example:**
```zexus
contract Storage {
    state data: map<str, str> = {};
    
    action set(key: str, value: str) {
        data[key] = value;
    }
    
    action get(key: str) -> str {
        return data.get(key, "");
    }
}

contract Controller {
    state storage_ref: any = null;
    
    action init(storage_contract: any) {
        storage_ref = storage_contract;  // Stores as ContractReference
    }
    
    action store_data(key: str, value: str) {
        storage_ref.set(key, value);  // Method call through reference
    }
    
    action get_storage_address() -> str {
        return storage_ref.address;  // Attribute access through reference
    }
}
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Method calls: `contract_ref.action_name(args)`
- ✅ Attribute access: `contract_ref.address`, `contract_ref.name`
- ✅ Persistence: References survive serialization/deserialization
- ✅ Transparency: Works exactly like direct contract access

**Impact:**
- Contracts can now build complex multi-contract systems
- References are fully transparent to Zexus code
- Enables contract factories, registries, and dependency injection patterns

**Documentation:** See `docs/CONTRACT_REFERENCES.md` for comprehensive guide.

## Upgrade Notes

### Breaking Changes
**None** - These are purely additive fixes that expand what's possible without breaking existing code.

### New Capabilities
1. Nested map literals work correctly in all contexts, including contract state
2. Keywords can now be used as variable names in most contexts
3. Standalone code blocks work correctly
4. Parser optimization: Closing braces and semicolons handled correctly
5. Contract-to-contract references with full transparency
6. Contracts can store references to other contracts that persist across state changes
7. More complex control flow patterns supported

### Migration
No migration needed - existing code continues to work unchanged. Code that previously failed due to the DATA keyword parser bug will now work correctly.

## What's Next

### Potential Future Improvements
1. **Enhanced Error Messages:** Continue improving error messages for edge cases

2. **Parser Performance:** Further optimize the advanced parser for better performance with very large files

3. **Strong Typing for Contract References:** Add dedicated contract type annotations instead of using `any`

4. **Cross-Chain Contract References:** Extend contract references to work across different blockchain instances
