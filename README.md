# Ziver Chain: The Self-Evolving Quantum-Resistant Blockchain

Ziver Chain is a next-generation blockchain that combines AI-enhanced consensus, quantum-resistant cryptography, and self-evolving architecture to create the most advanced distributed ledger technology.

## ✨ Features

- **🤖 AI-Enhanced Consensus**: Zenith AI optimizes validator selection and network parameters
- **🔒 Quantum-Resistant Cryptography**: SPHINCS+ and lattice-based cryptography for future-proof security
- **🔄 Self-Evolving Architecture**: Automatic parameter adjustments without hard forks
- **📖 Explainable Transactions**: Every transaction includes AI-generated explanations
- **⚡ High Performance**: Built on TON with multi-chain compatibility

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Zexus compiler (see [zexus/](../zexus/))
- Node.js 16+ (for build tools)
- Rust (for cryptographic operations)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ZiverLabs/ZiverLabs.git
cd ZiverLabs/ziver-chain

# Install dependencies
zpm install

# Build the project
zpm build

# Run a node
zx src/main.zx --network=testnet
```

Running a Node

```bash
# Start a validator node
zx src/main.zx --validator --stake=1000

# Start a full node
zx src/main.zx --full-node

# Start an archive node
zx src/main.zx --archive-node
```

🔧 Development

Building from Source

```bash
# Build in release mode
zpm build --release

# Build with specific features
zpm build --features "quantum_resistance ai_consensus"
```

Testing

```bash
# Run unit tests
zpm test

# Run integration tests
zpm test --integration

# Run with specific test cases
zpm test --test consensus_tests
```

📊 Network Participation

Becoming a Validator

1. Acquire ZIV tokens
2. Run a validator node with sufficient stake
3. Register your validator address
4. Participate in consensus

Staking

Delegate your tokens to validators to earn rewards and help secure the network.

🔐 Security

Ziver Chain implements multiple security layers:

1. Quantum-Resistant Signatures: SPHINCS+ and lattice-based cryptography
2. AI-Threat Detection: Real-time monitoring for anomalous behavior
3. Formal Verification: Zexus enables mathematically proven correctness
4. Bug Bounty Program: Rewards for identifying vulnerabilities

📈 Performance Metrics

· Throughput: 10,000+ TPS (theoretical)
· Finality: 2-4 seconds
· Block Time: 12 seconds
· Storage: ~100GB/year for full nodes
