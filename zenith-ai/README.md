# Zenith AI: The Explainable AI Framework

Zenith AI is an adaptive artificial intelligence framework capable of causal reasoning, hyper-conceptual thinking, and transparent decision-making. It brings true understanding to AI systems.

## ✨ Features

- **🧠 Causal Reasoning**: Understands cause-effect relationships
- **💡 Hyper-Conceptual Thinking**: Forms abstract concepts and connections
- **📖 Explainable Decisions**: Provides clear reasoning for every decision
- **🔄 Adaptive Learning**: Continuously improves from new data
- **🔒 Ethical AI**: Built-in safety and fairness controls

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Install Zenith AI
zpm install zenith_ai

# Or build from source
git clone https://github.com/ZiverLabs/ZiverLabs.git
cd ZiverLabs/zenith-ai
zpm install
zpm build
```

Basic Usage

```zexus
use zenith_ai from "zenith_ai/core/inference.zx"

# Initialize AI
let ai = zenith_ai.create()

# Train on data
ai.train(training_data)

# Make predictions
let prediction = ai.predict(new_data)

# Get explanation
let explanation = ai.explain(prediction)
print "Decision reason: {explanation}"
```

🧠 Core Concepts

Adaptive Self-Regulating Explainable Hybrid (ASREH)

The ASREH algorithm consists of three components:

1. Self-Supervised World Model (SSWM): Learns environment dynamics
2. Adaptive Reasoning Learning Controller (ARLC): Makes intelligent decisions
3. Explainability Module (EM): Provides transparent explanations

Conceptual Attention Layer

A novel neural network layer that understands conceptual relationships between entities, actions, and properties.

📊 Applications

Blockchain Optimization

```zexus
use zenith_ai from "../zenith-ai/modules/blockchain_ai.zx"

action optimize_blockchain(blockchain_state: Map<text, any>):
  let analysis = zenith_ai.analyze_blockchain(blockchain_state)
  let recommendations = zenith_ai.recommend_parameters(analysis)
  return recommendations
```

Threat Detection

```zexus
use zenith_ai from "../zenith-ai/modules/threat_detection.zx"

action monitor_threats(network_data: List<Transaction>):
  let threats = zenith_ai.detect_threats(network_data)
  for each threat in threats:
    print "Threat detected: {threat.type} - {threat.description}"
```
